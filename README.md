## GPU Radar 📡

GPU Radar is an app dedicated to helping users find top Amazon Marketplace listings for Nvidea's RTX 3 Series Cards in the tough and scarse GPU market in today's time. GPU Radar scans through the Amazon Marketplace in 5-10 minute intervals, detecting any low price offerings for GPU's that could dissapear unnoticed by shoppers. GPU Radar assists shoppers get access to low price GPU deals before scalpers wishing to resell them for a higher price do.

## Reflection 📝

  - What was the context for this project? (ie: was this a side project? was this for Turing? was this for an experiment?)
  - What did you set out to build?
  - Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?
  - What were some unexpected obstacles?
  - What tools did you use to implement this project?
      - This might seem obvious because you are IN this codebase, but to all other humans now is the time to talk about why you chose webpack instead of create react app, or D3, or vanilla JS instead of a framework etc. Brag about your choices and justify them here.  

The GPU Radar app was created for my Mobile Application Development class's final project. As part of the requirements of the final project, all projects had to include a database element and data exchange with an API.
